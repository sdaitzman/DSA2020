## Exercise 1: Greedy Heuristic Traveling Salesman Algorithm
> Implement a greedy heuristic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem.  We discussed a few options during class, but you are also free to invent your own.  Be sure tospecify your algorithm below in a couple of sentences and explain why it is a greedy approach.

I will implement a greedy heuristic-based traveling salesman algorithm using a nearest-neighbor approach. The nearest-neighbor approach tries to minimize the number of trips taken all the way across the map, traversing redundant distance, by using node distance as its heuristic. It simply begins at one node, marks it as visited, gets the node that is closest, travels there, and repeats. This will perform decently well for many basic cases, but can be tripped up easily and does not always find anything near an optimal solution. It is a greedy algorithm because at every instance of a node, it will choose the path that will add the least additional distance. This is its strength and its weakness---at each step, it will only add the minimum additional length possible, but this can add more distance later than is saved at the local substep.


## Exercise 2: Local Search Heuristic Traveling Salesman Algorithm
> Implement a local search heuristic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem.We discussed a few options during class, but you are also free to invent your own.  Be sure to specify your algorithm below in a couple of sentences and explain why it is a local searchapproach.  To find an initial solution, your algorithm should run the greedy algorithm youimplemented above.

To implement a local search heuristic-based traveling salesman algorithm, I will use a two-opt approach. The two-opt approach will take two edges somewhere in the graph, try swapping them as an experiment, and accept the swap if it improves the overall distance. It can be run to continue doing this until no improvement is found. For a pair of edges $(u_1, u_2)$ and $(v_1, v_2)$ it would try the alternate edges $(u1, v2)$ and $(v1, u2)$ which could reduce the total distance by eliminating an unnecessary crossing pathway.

In my implementation, I also support constraining the total number of iterations of the algorithm, and the size of the local neighborhood that will be inspected around each edge to find other edges to swap. The algorithm will continue until it hits these constraints, and in the case of the max iterations constraint it will return its best incarnation of the list yet as soon as it hits the constraint.

## Exercise 3: Results
> Compare the results of your algorithms by recording the runtimes and optimality gaps.  Depending on your chosen algorithm, you should also consider different starting conditions that may affect the performance.  Record your results in a table below.  Then, in a few sentences, comment what you observe.  Do the results match what you expected?

## Questions/Things to Follow Up On
- 2-opt vs. 3-opt vs. Lin-Kernigham heuristic. I read about these, but don't fully understand them all, and want to try programming (and/or visualizing) them later.
